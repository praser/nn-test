# Technical interview

This is a simple test to evaluate your technical skills.

To help you there are a few useful scripts in the `package.json` file that you can use to run the tests and the type checker.

## 1. Make the tests green

Fix the implementation of the functions `titleCase` and `capitalize` in order to make all the tests pass. (you must not change the tests)

## 2. Create a pipeline in github actions

The pipeline must run the tests and the type checker in github actions
